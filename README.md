🔍 Key Insights & Findings
Our analysis of the OmniMart dataset led to the following key insights:
1. Retention is the growth engine — Customer Lifetime Value (CLV ≈ ₹14.2K) is 10× a single order, meaning retention programs are far more profitable than acquisition.
2. Revenue is volume-driven — Electronics (₹97.4M) and Grocery (₹91.1M) dominate sales; weaker categories like Clothing and Books underperform.
3. Churn risk is high — 27.5% of customers are at risk of leaving, posing a significant future revenue threat.
4. Customer experience gaps exist — Ratings skew toward 4 stars, but many 2–3 star reviews reveal pain points around delivery, product quality, and service.
5. Revenue concentration risk — Heavy reliance on the US market and a handful of VIP customers makes OmniMart vulnerable to shocks.
6. Opportunities for growth — Cross-selling, geographic diversification, loyalty programs, and targeting female shoppers present major upside potential.
